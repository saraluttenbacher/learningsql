# Notes

- Database used in course = Quiz Data
  - Two tables
    - people - 1000 fake quiz participants
    - states - states in USA
- In github coderspace:
  - ctrl+shift+P opens command bar
  - run command for SQLite: open database, select database and open
  - create a .sql file named working, save code there. right click and select run code to run.

 ## What is a database?

 - collection of information and relationships between data
  - stored in columns (fields) and rows (records) = tables
- all records have the same fields
- database = tables and the relationships we set between the tables
- schema = layout of fields, tables, and relationships

## What is SQL?
- Structured Query Language - manipulate and define data in database
  - how we write the questions we want to ask the database
- Write a question a computer can understand
  - series of smaller questions chained together
- SQL is used in alot of databases
- Dual role of SQL - can be used as a Data Manipulation Language or Data Definition Language
  - CRUD records
  - edit schema
  

### SQL Statements
- something you write in SQL to get info from or change a database is a statement
- SQL is whitespace independant (ignore white spaces)
- Statements made of clauses
- clauses made of key words, operators, field names, table names, and predicates
  - key words and operators are ALL CAPS
- Semicolon at end of every statement


## Select Statement
- Tells SQL we want it to choose specific piece of data
- Select statement can also return text
- ```SQL
  SELECT field_name FROM table_name;
  ```
- Single Quotes '' will return text
- ```SQL
  SELECT 'Hello, World!;
  ```
- Select multiple fields by listing them out and seperating them with a comma
- ```SQL
  SELECT first_name, last_name FROM people;
  ```
  - You can select the fields in whatever order you would like
- * is a wildcard character. It will select all the columns in a table
- ```SQL
  SELECT * FROM people;
  ```


## WHERE Statement
- Filter results from SELECT with a WHERE statement
- ```SQL
  SELECT * FROM people WHERE state_code='CA';
  ```
  - Beware: Some fields are set up as case sensitive. Searching for 'ca' returns nothing
- Use whitespace/newlines to make code easier for humans to read
- ```SQL
  SELECT first_name, last, name, shirt_or_hat
  FROM people
  WHERE
  shirt_or_hat='shirt';
  ```
- ORDER MATTERS!!! SELECT, then FROM, then WHERE. SQL will not understand a different clause order
- ```SQL
  /* Improper Statement */
  WHERE shirt_or_hat='shirt'
  FROM people
  SELECT first_name, last_name, shirt_or_hat;
  ```

## Logical Statements and Operators
- The logical statement AND lets you set multiple different criteria for a filter.
- ```SQL
  SELECT first_name, last_name FROM people WHERE state_code='CA' AND shirt_or_hat='shirt';
  ```
- ```SQL
  SELECT team, first_name, last_name FROM people WHERE state_code='CA' AND shirt_or_hat='shirt' AND team='Angry Ants';
  ```
- Adding an ! before an = tells SQL you want to exclude that value from your query
- ```SQL
  SELECT team, first_name, last_name FROM people WHERE state_code='CA' AND shirt_or_hat='shirt' AND team!='Angry Ants';
  ```
  - You can also use <> and IS NOT for not equal to.

 - You can use IS and IS NOT in place of an equals symbol
- ```SQL
  SELECT team, first_name, last_name FROM people WHERE state_code='CA' AND shirt_or_hat='shirt' AND team IS 'Angry Ants';
  ```
- ```SQL
  SELECT team, first_name, last_name FROM people WHERE state_code='CA' AND shirt_or_hat='shirt' AND team IS NOT 'Angry Ants';
  ```
- Use OR to return either of two criteria
- ```SQL
  SELECT team, first_name, last_name FROM people WHERE state_code='CA' OR state_code='CO' AND shirt_or_hat='shirt' AND team IS 'Angry Ants';
  ```
- Use parenthesis to tell SQL what order to read the clauses in
- ```SQL
  SELECT team, first_name, last_name, shirt_or_hat, state_code FROM people WHERE (state_code='CA' OR state_code='CO') AND shirt_or_hat='shirt' AND team IS 'Angry Ants';
  ```

## LIKE Operator

- Use the LIKE operator and the wildcard % to return results where part of the string is a match
- ```SQL
  SELECT first_name, last_name, state_Code
  FROM people
  WHERE state_code LIKE 'C%';
  ```
  - % can come before, after, or on both sides of the constant
  - % can be any length of text
  - some fields are case sensitive and some are not - depends on how field is set up

## LIMIT Operator

- limit the number of results that get returned with LIMIT
- ```SQL
  SELECT * FROM people
  WHERE company
  LIKE '%LLC'
  LIMIT 5;
  ```
  - returns the first n records
- use OFFSET after limit to return n records after the first k records
- ```SQL
  SELECT *
  FROM people
  WHERE company
  LIKE '%LLC'
  LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;
  ```

## ORDER BY
- by default, SQL will return the results in the order that they are stored in the database
- Use ORDERBY to sort the result alphanumerically by the specified field.
- ```SQL
  SELECT first_name, last_name
  FROM people
  ORDER BY first_name;
  ```
  - Ascending order by default
  - You can add ASC or DESC after the column name to specify ascending or descending order. 
  - You can add multiple criteria to order by
 
## LENGTH, DISTINCT, COUNT

- to get the number of characters in each row for a specified column, use the LENGTH() command
- ```SQL
  SELECT first_name, LENGTH(first_name)
  FROM people;
  ```
- to get every unique value from a field, use DISTINCT()
- ```SQL
  SELECT DISTINCT(first_name)
  FROM people;
  ```
- Use COUNT to get the number of rows in your dataset that match your filter criteria
- ```SQL
  SELECT COUNT(company)
  FROM people
  WHERE state_code LIKE '%LLC';
  ```
  - this will return the number of companies that end in LLC in your dataset
